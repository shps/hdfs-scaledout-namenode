2. start the mysql server for the cluster
3. Run the following scripts:
./deploy.sh - deploys the HDFS binaries from this machine onto all of the machines/accounts in hosts.txt

For nn-throughput, run:
./nn-throughput/start-kthfs.sh - this starts a NN on each of the clusters listed in hosts.txt
./nn-throughput/start-test.sh
./nn-throughput/fetch-results.sh

For loadgen, run:
./loadgen/start-kthfs.sh - this starts a NN and DN on each of the clusters listed in hosts.txt
./loadgen/start-test.sh
./loadgen/fetch-results.sh
